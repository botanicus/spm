h1. About

SPM means *stupid package manager*. It manage packages in the Node.js way: it just put them into @~/.node_libraries@. It use Git or GitHub for installation and it can even search on GitHub via GitHub API.

SPM is totally unobtrusive, it won't ever be required in runtime, it won't think about its own ways how and where should be packages stored, it just use Node.js convention.
